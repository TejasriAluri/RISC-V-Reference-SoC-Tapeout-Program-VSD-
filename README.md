Welcome! I am **Tejasri Aluri** and this repo documents my journey through the VSD SoC Tapeout Program with RISC-V.  
Youâ€™ll find everything from tool installations, lab assignments to reference SoC implementations.

## What is VSD & SFAL?

- **VSD** = VLSI System Design  
- **SFAL** = Semiconductor Fundamentals & Advanced Learning â€” the foundation track involving setup of essential tools and RTLâ€‘toâ€‘GDS flow labs.

## ðŸ“š Repository Structure & Week0

- **Week0**
  - [Task1 â€’ GitHub Setup & Video Summary](./Week0/Task1_GitHubSetup/README.md)
  - [Task2 â€’ Tool Installation & Snapshots](./Week0/Task2_ToolInstallation/README.md)

## System Environment (My VM)

- RAM: 6 GB  
- Disk: 50 GB  
- vCPUs: 4  
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04+

## ðŸš€ My Goals

- Get solid handsâ€‘on with openâ€‘source VLSI tools and the RTL â†’ GDS flow  
- Build a reference SoC (RISCâ€‘V) by the end of the program  
- Keep clean documentation of each weekâ€™s tasks, learning and challenges.
**Letâ€™s begin! ðŸš€**
